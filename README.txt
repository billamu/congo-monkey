'Congo' is a lightweight, easy-to-use game framework for the Monkey programming language (http://www.monkey-x.com/ or http://www.monkeycoder.co.nz/).

Currently the module is tested against Monkey Pro version 76d -- other versions may work but have not been tested, and may require changes. 

Usage: copy the 'congo' folder into <monkey>/modules. To use the physics classes, you will also need to copy the 'box2d' folder into <monkey>/module (or download the box2d classes separately). To test the module, try running the applications in the Examples folder.
