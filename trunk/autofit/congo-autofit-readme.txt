Based on 'AutoFit 2.0: Virtual display library' (by James Boyd 'Hitoro/DruggedBunny'), these functions provide a way to deal with different display resolutions. This code is in the public domain (see source file). 

See also http://www.monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=1500 for more information.  

The autofit code does not generate monkeydoc documentation.

The code is compatible with Congo retina options and the HD image resource loader. Any changes made for Congo will be noted by '[CONGO]' comments in the source files.

Changes:

    Added an argument in UpdateVirtualDisplay to disable drawing the borders entirely. You can then use it just for scaling, and draw outside the game area to fill the space (rather than leave it blank).
