These docs are a subset of the full docs generated using the bin/makedocs command in Monkey/Ted, with a simplified page template (so only Congo pages appear, not mixed in with other modules).

To regenerate: delete (or move) the docs/html folder to ensure a clean rebuild. Back-up the main page_template.html in docs/templates/devolonter, replace with the congo version and re-build the docs (can do from inside monkey, or manually). 
Copy the contents of the html folder elsewhere, then restore the original monkey docs by
putting back the moved folder or by doing a clean rebuild with the original template in place.
