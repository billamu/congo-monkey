'Congo Bird' game example for Congo. 

A flapping bird game.
This example shows use of sprites, layers, animation, fonts, actions, sounds,
and simple player input. It also shows how you can store level items, perform
sprite scrolling, and do basic collision detection.

sd/hd/xhd versions of resources are included. The backdrop images are designed
to be larger than the virtual game area, allowing the full screen to be used
on most mobile devices (4:3 to 16:9 aspect ratios), whilst retaining a consistent
320x480 (point) virtual game area.

+++ This code forms the basis of 'Plucky Parrot', which is available for free from
the App Store and Google Play from March 2014! +++

***

As with all Monkey projects, you may wish to edit the target-specific build files 
(e.g. MonkeyGame.html, MonkeyGame.as etc) to set the desired display size.
For this game, try 320x480 or 640x960 (portrait).
