'Softtarget' game example for Congo. 
This shows use of many classes including parent/child sprites, layers, 
animation, particles, buttons, fonts, and actions. It also uses the
Touchmanager for input.

sd/hd/xhd versions of resources are included. There is also code for loading 
device-specific images for iPad and iPhone5, so the full screen is used.

Some graphics are stored on sprite 
sheets, made using TexturePacker.

***

As with all Monkey projects, you may wish to edit the target-specific build files 
(e.g. MonkeyGame.html, MonkeyGame.as etc) to set the desired display size.
